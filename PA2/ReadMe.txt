Fill the functions in CartoonImage.py to generate the canny edge detection, bilateral filter and 
cartoon image

You will have to implement your own bilateral filter and canny edge detection and
 compare functions in python opencv

You can compare your output images with CannyOutput.jpg, BilateralOutput.jpg, cartoon.jpg 

I have commented the functions of canny and biltaeral functions since they are not implemented.

Just run the Cartoon image file and its will give the output for the cartoon image.
